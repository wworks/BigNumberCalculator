# Big Number Calculator in VB.Net

An Big Number Calculator to calculate very large whole numbers, the max amount of digits you can get in VB is ±28 with a Decimal, the Big Number Calculator will go upto 1000 digits. You can basically calculate with Strings now! 
It supports and handles negative numbers and corner cases of specific operations. The built-in functions are:

• Add
• Subtract
• Multiply
• Divide
    You can specify the amount of digits you want, or how many decimal places.)
• Exponent
    Arguments are Integers, here the result is most important and can be 1000+ digits
• Modulus
• IntegerDivision
• Max
• Min
• BiggerThan
• IsZero

Allmost all of these will work with 1000 digits, and return the result instantly(Division is still too slow for 1000 digit numbers, though. Up to 300 digits it works fine.)

The code has Function comments and descriptions. Also, the code itself is commented if you want to take a look at it.

### All functions are thoroughly tested, but needless to say, i don't take any responsibility for any wrong answers :)
